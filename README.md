# HooHacks Music Workshop 2021 - How to Use MaxMSP with Node.js

MaxMSP is a visual programming language used to dynamically create music. In this GitHub, we have included basic code that accompanies the workshop as well as finished code for later.

## Installation

Make sure you have Node.js and npm. You can download them [here](https://nodejs.org/en/).

Download Max 8 [here](https://cycling74.com/downloads). Max is free for 30 days.

## Usage of Finished Code

First, run the Node.js file.
```bash
node face_interpreter.js
```
Then, open up Max and under the File tab, open INSERT_NAME_HERE.maxpat. Then click the button labeled ```script start``` and click one of the names in the patch.
## Face API
The post request currently on ```face_interpreter.js``` will be live for the duration of hacking at HooHacks, however, please do not use it in your own projects. It will be dismantled once hacking ends and will not work come judging time.
